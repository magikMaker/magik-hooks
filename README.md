magik-hooks
===========
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/magik-hooks.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/magik-hooks)

Tiny utility to manage [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) 
using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It can create, update or remove a git hook. 

Install
-------
Install this in your project like this:
```bash
$ npm install --save-dev magik-hooks
```

Usage
-----
After installation, you can use this package in your code like this:
```js
// require magik-hooks so it's available
const magikHooks = require('magik-hooks');

// create a new hook, assuming the variable `commands` holds the actual 
// commands as a string. Optionally provide an `identifier` so the hook can be 
// removed easily at a later time. (In case you're running multiple scripts 
//from one git hook
magikHooks.create('pre-commit', commands[, identifier]);

// removes a hook, optionally provide an identifier so only that particular 
// hook will be removed.
magikHooks.remove('pre-commit'[, identifier]);

```

Uninstall
---------
To uninstall, simply type this on the command line:
```bash
$ npm uninstall --save-dev magik-hooks
```
